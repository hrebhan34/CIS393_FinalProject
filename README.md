# CIS393_FinalProject
My starting page is home.ejs. After succesffuly doing an inseert,delete,update,search, or display you should automatically be redirected back to the home page. Insert adds a new member to the email list. Delete measn that they are unsubscribing from the memebership and will automatically take them out of the email_list database. Update only changes the date column because the idea is that they are just renewing their memebership and nothing else has changed. As for search, we are searching the table using the student ID number which will then display the rest of their information. And then display all shows you all the information of each memeber in the table.
